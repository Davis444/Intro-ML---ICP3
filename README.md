Numpy Array Operations
This Python script demonstrates various operations using Numpy arrays. Here's a summary of what each part of the code does:

Task 1: Random Vector and Array Reshaping
Generates a random vector of size 15 with integers in the range 1-20.
Reshapes the vector into a 3x5 array.
Replaces the maximum value in each row with 0.
Task 2: Creating a 4x3 Array
Creates a 4x3 array with 4-byte integer elements.
Task 3: Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Computes the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a given square array.
Task 4: Summing Diagonal Elements
Computes the sum of diagonal elements of a given array.
Task 5: Reshaping Arrays
Reshapes an array without changing its data, first to a 3x2 array and then to a 2x3 array.


CSV Data Analysis
This Python script analyzes data from a CSV file named 'data.csv'. Here are the tasks performed by the script:

Task 1: Read CSV File
Reads the provided CSV file from the given Google Drive link.
Task 2: Basic Statistical Description
Computes basic statistical description (mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.) of the data.
Task 3: Check for Null Values
Checks if the data contains any null values.
Task 4: Replace Null Values
If null values are found, replaces them with the mean of the respective column.
Task 5: Aggregate Data
Selects at least two columns and aggregates the data using functions like min, max, count, and mean.
Task 6: Filter Dataframe
Filters the dataframe to select rows with calories values between 500 and 1000.
Task 7: Advanced Filtering
Filters the dataframe to select rows with calories values > 500 and pulse < 100.
Task 8: Create Modified Dataframe
Creates a new dataframe 'df_modified' that contains all columns from the original dataframe except 'Maxpulse'.
Task 9: Convert Data Types
Converts the datatype of the Calories column to integer datatype.
